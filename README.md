# Card payment processing with Checkout API

### This is a simple example of how you can accept credit card payments by integrating our [Checkout API](https://developers.mercadopago.com/en/guides/payments/api/introduction)
*We put everything explained in our documentation into practice, in order for you to see theory in action quickly!*

### In this repository you will find two main folders:

- `client`: 
  
    Basic implementation of a checkout and its payment form, complying all security requirements to collect sensitive user information.

- `server`: 

    Basic server-side implementation, serving client-side static resources and allowing to post collected information directly to our API and process a payment request.

## How to run it

Clone or [download](https://github.com/mercadopago/card-payment-sample/archive/master.zip) this project, move to the server implementation of your choose and folllow it's README instructions.

If you need another programming language, you are able to use only our vanilla client-side sample and write your own server-side implementation following our [API Reference](https://developers.mercadopago.com/en/reference/payments/_payments/post/).
